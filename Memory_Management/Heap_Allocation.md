# Heap Allocation 

## Introduction

Welcome to the last layer of memory allocation, the heap, this is where usually the vaorious alloc functions are implemented. This layer usually is built on top of the other memory levels/services (the physical memory, virtual memory, paging). 

Depending how the operating system is designed, this layer can return either physical or virtual addresses, for our purposes we will assume that the operating system has paging enabled and a basic virtual memory support, this means that our heap allocator will work with virtual addresses.
